> Structure a coding project to be made by a very small group of people. Hosted on github, and would be a pleasant project to recruiters viewing it.

**Project Idea:**

"CodeCafé" - A web-based platform where developers can share their personal coding projects, get feedback from
peers, and learn from others.

**Team Size: 3-4 people**

* Each member will have a clear role and responsibility, making it easy for them to focus on specific aspects of
the project.
* With a small team size, communication is crucial. Regular meetings, pair programming, and code reviews will
ensure everyone stays informed and aligned.

**Project Structure:**

1. **GitHub Repository:**
        * Create a private repository on GitHub with a clear name (e.g., `codecafe`) and description.
        * Set up a simple README file that outlines the project's goals, technologies used, and team members' roles.
2. **Feature List:**
        * Define 3-5 features for the first release:
                + User registration and login system
                + Project submission and review feature
                + Basic project search functionality
                + Simple user profile with personal projects showcased
        * Prioritize features based on complexity and importance.
3. **Tools and Technologies:**
        * Choose a modern web framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js for the frontend.
        * Select a suitable backend technology, such as Node.js, Django, or Flask, depending on your team's expertise.
        * Use a lightweight database like SQLite or PostgreSQL to store project information.
4. **Development Roadmap:**
        * Break down the project into smaller tasks and create a rough timeline for each feature.
        * Schedule regular meetings to review progress, discuss any challenges, and align on next steps.

**Recruiter-Friendly Aspects:**

1. **Clear README file:** Showcase your team's communication skills by maintaining an up-to-date README that
highlights the project's goals, features, and technologies used.
2. **Code organization:** Use a consistent coding style, commit messages, and branch naming conventions to
demonstrate attention to detail.
3. **Collaborative development:** Emphasize the importance of teamwork through GitHub pull requests, code reviews,
and contributions from all team members.
4. **Problem-solving:** Document any challenges you faced during development, how you addressed them, and what you
learned from the experience.

**Features for Recruiters:**

1. **Personalized Projects:** Showcase your individual coding projects within the CodeCafé platform to demonstrate
skills and interests.
2. **Code Review:** Allow recruiters to review your codebase, providing valuable feedback on quality,
organization, and adherence to best practices.
3. **Teamwork Experience:** Highlight the collaborative nature of the project by showcasing pull requests,
comments, and reviews from all team members.

**Tips for Recruiters:**

1. **Explore the Code:** Review the entire codebase to assess your understanding of technologies, coding
standards, and problem-solving skills.
2. **Evaluate Teamwork:** Browse through GitHub pull requests, comments, and reviews to gauge collaboration and
conflict resolution.
3. **Assess Project Quality:** Evaluate the overall quality of the project, paying attention to design,
functionality, and scalability.

**Additional Tips:**

1. **Keep a public-facing blog or journal:** Share your development experience, lessons learned, and challenges
faced during the project.
2. **Conduct code walkthroughs:** Schedule regular code walkthroughs with recruiters or industry experts to
demonstrate your understanding of complex topics.
3. **Highlight transferable skills:** Emphasize soft skills like communication, problem-solving, and teamwork that
are valuable in any professional setting.

By following this structured approach, you'll create a visually appealing project on GitHub that showcases your
team's skills, communication, and problem-solving abilities – making it an attractive opportunity for recruiters!
