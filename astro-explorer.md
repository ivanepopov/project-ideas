> Structure a coding project to be made by a very small group of people, and mainly in C++. Hosted on github, and would be a pleasant project to recruiters viewing it. Provide a large variety of features to add more depth to the project.

**Project Idea:**

"AstroExplorer" - A comprehensive astronomy simulation program that allows users to explore planetary systems, simulate celestial events, visualize astronomical data, and interact with a virtual observatory.

**Team Size: 3-4 people**

* Each member will have a clear role and responsibility, making it easy for them to focus on specific aspects of the project.
* With a small team size, communication is crucial. Regular meetings, pair programming, and code reviews will ensure everyone stays informed and aligned.

**Project Structure:**

1. **GitHub Repository:**
        * Create a private repository on GitHub with a clear name (e.g., `astroexplorer`) and description.
        * Set up a simple README file that outlines the project's goals, technologies used, and team members' roles.
2. **Feature List:**
        * Define 10-15 features for the first release:
                + Simulate planetary orbits using Newtonian mechanics
                + Visualize astronomical data (e.g., star charts, planet positions) using a library like OpenGL or SDL
                + Allow users to create and manage their own planetary systems
                + Implement basic event handling (e.g., solar eclipses, planetary alignments)
                + Integrate a celestial body catalog with accurate orbital parameters
                + Include a user interface for navigating the simulated universe
                + Provide tools for analyzing astronomical data (e.g., Fourier transforms, wavelet analysis)
                + Implement a virtual observatory that simulates telescopic observations
                + Support for importing and exporting data in popular astronomy formats (e.g., CSV, FITS)
                + Integration with external libraries (e.g., Boost.Math, Eigen) for advanced calculations
        * Prioritize features based on complexity and importance.
3. **Tools and Technologies:**
        * Use the C++11 standard for modern language features.
        * Utilize a library like Qt or SFML for GUI and graphics-related tasks.
        * Choose a suitable math library (e.g., Boost.Math) for scientific calculations.
        * Integrate external libraries (e.g., Eigen, BLAS) for efficient numerical computations.
4. **Development Roadmap:**
        * Break down the project into smaller tasks and create a rough timeline for each feature.
        * Schedule regular meetings to review progress, discuss any challenges, and align on next steps.

3. **Data Visualization:** Highlight your understanding of data visualization concepts and ability to create informative graphics using a library like OpenGL or SDL.
4. **Integration with External Libraries:** Show proficiency in integrating external libraries (e.g., Boost.Math, Eigen) for advanced calculations.

**Additional Features:**

1. **User-Defined Celestial Bodies:** Allow users to define their own celestial bodies with custom properties and behaviors.
2. **Solar System Simulations:** Implement simulations of solar system formation, planetary migration, and other complex astrophysical processes.
3. **Telescope Simulation:** Create a realistic simulation of telescopic observations, including effects like atmospheric distortion and optical aberrations.
4. **Data Analysis Tools:** Provide tools for analyzing astronomical data (e.g., Fourier transforms, wavelet analysis) to aid in scientific research.

**Tips for Recruiters:**

1. **Evaluate Code Quality:** Review the entire codebase to assess your understanding of C++ language features, coding standards, and problem-solving skills.
2. **Assess Teamwork Experience:** Browse through GitHub pull requests, comments, and reviews to gauge collaboration and conflict resolution.
3. **Review Project Documentation:** Evaluate the quality and completeness of project documentation (e.g., README, user manual) to assess communication skills.

**Additional Tips:**

1. **Create a public-facing blog or journal:** Share your development experience, lessons learned, and challenges faced during the project.
2. **Conduct code walkthroughs:** Schedule regular code walkthroughs with recruiters or industry experts to demonstrate your understanding of complex topics.
3. **Highlight transferable skills:** Emphasize soft skills like communication, problem-solving, and teamwork that are valuable in any professional setting.
