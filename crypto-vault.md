> Structure a new coding project to be made by a very small group of people, and mainly in C++. Hosted on github, with a well structured file tree, which would be pleasant to recruiters. Provide a large variety of features to add more depth to the project. Also, provide information on the skills, libraries, etc. that will be needed.
