> Structure a new coding project to be made by a very small group of people, and mainly in C++. Hosted on github, with a well structured file tree, which would be pleasant to recruiters. Provide a large variety of features to add more depth to the project. Also, provide information on the skills, libraries, etc. that will be needed.

**Core Features:**

1. **Weather Data Retrieval:** Use APIs to retrieve current and forecasted weather data from various sources.
2. **Advanced Algorithms:** Implement algorithms like Kalman filter, machine learning models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees), and others for accurate forecasting.
3. **Data Structures:** Design custom data structures (e.g., hash tables, graphs) for efficient storage and retrieval of large amounts of weather data.
4. **GUI Interface:** Create a user-friendly interface using Qt or SFML to visualize weather data, including current conditions, forecasts, and historical trends.

**Additional Features:**

1. **Weather Station Integration:** Integrate with local weather stations to retrieve real-time weather data.
2. **Machine Learning Model Training:** Train machine learning models on historical weather data to improve forecasting accuracy.
3. **Alert System:** Implement an alert system to notify users of extreme weather conditions (e.g., hurricanes, tornadoes).
4. **Multi-Language Support:** Add support for multiple languages to cater to a global audience.

**Skills and Libraries:**

1. **C++11/C++14 features:** Utilize modern C++ language features, such as auto, range-based for loops, and smart pointers.
2. **Qt or SFML:** Use a GUI library (e.g., Qt, SFML) to create a user-friendly interface.
3. **API wrappers:** Write API wrappers using libraries like Poco or Boost to interact with weather data services.
4. **Machine learning libraries:** Utilize machine learning libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, OpenCV) for implementing advanced algorithms and training models.

**Tools and Technologies:**
