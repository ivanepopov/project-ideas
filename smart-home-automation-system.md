>Structure a new coding project to be made by a very small group of people, and mainly in C++. Hosted on github, with a well structured file tree, which would be pleasant to recruiters. Provide a large variety of features to add more depth to the project. Also, provide information on the skills, libraries, etc. that will be needed.

 ### Project Title: Smart Home Automation System (SHAS)

### Overview:
SHAS is an advanced home automation system designed to control and monitor various smart devices in a user's home
through a single interface. The system will utilize IoT technologies to connect and manage devices such as lights,
thermostats, locks, and more. SHAS will be built using C++ for performance critical parts and modern web
technologies for the mobile and web interfaces.

### Features:
1. **Device Management:** Add, remove, and manage various smart devices.
2. **Control Interfaces:** Mobile app interface for controlling devices via a mobile device or browser.
3. **Automations:** Create complex automations using if-this-then-that rules.
4. **User Authentication:** Secure login system to manage user profiles and settings.
5. **Real-time Data:** Visualize data in real-time, including device statuses and usage patterns.
6. **Scheduling:** Schedule tasks for devices (e.g., turning off lights before bed).
7. **Third-Party Integration:** Allow integration with other smart home systems via APIs.
8. **Security Features:** Strong encryption for data in transit and at rest, secure authentication mechanisms.
9. **Scalability:** Easily scale the system to add more devices or users.
10. **Extensible:** Easy to extend with new device types or features using C++ and modern web technologies.

### Skills Required:
- Proficient in C++.
- Understanding of networking concepts (TCP/IP, HTTP).
- Familiarity with IoT protocols like MQTT.
- Knowledge of modern web frameworks such as React or Vue for the mobile and web interfaces.
- Basic understanding of system architecture and scalability.
- Ability to work with APIs.
- Skills in security practices (encryption, authentication, secure coding).
- Experience with version control systems (Git) and project management tools like GitHub Projects or Jira.

### Libraries and Tools:
- **C++:** STL, Boost libraries for network programming and system utilities.
- **Web Interface:** React (or Vue) for the frontend, possibly using a framework like Electron for desktop apps.
- **Networking:** Libcurl for HTTP requests, MQTT library if using MQTT protocol.
- **Security:** OpenSSL or another crypto library for secure communications.
- **Utilities:** Google Test for unit testing, CMake for building and managing dependencies.

### Setup and Installation:
1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Install necessary libraries and tools as listed above.
3. Configure and compile using CMake (or equivalent build system).
4. Run tests to ensure everything works correctly.
5. Deploy on a server or local machine according to deployment scripts.

### Future Development:
SHAS will be developed iteratively with frequent updates focused on enhancing features, improving performance, and
adding new device types. Each release will include bug fixes, optimizations, and minor feature enhancements based
on user feedback. Major upgrades may include major architectural changes, new IoT protocols, or expanded mobile
app support.

### Conclusion:
This project provides a comprehensive platform for developing skills in C++ programming, system architecture,
networking, web development, and security practices. By leveraging modern technologies and frameworks, SHAS aims
to provide a robust, scalable, and user-friendly home automation solution that can be easily extended with new
features or integrated into existing smart home ecosystems.
